# Feature Implementation Plan: Interactive Article Selection

## Overview

**Feature Name:** Interactive Article Selection for HackerCast
**Created:** September 17, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase

### Business Requirements

Add an interactive selection mechanism that allows users to review and choose which articles to scrape and convert to audio before processing. This feature addresses the need for user control over content while maintaining the opt-out (rather than opt-in) philosophy for quick decision making.

### User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to see a list of article headlines from the top Hacker News stories so I can quickly scan for relevant content.

2. **As a user**, I want articles to be pre-selected by default so I can quickly deselect unwanted articles rather than manually selecting each one.

3. **As a user**, I want a fast, keyboard-friendly interface so I can make selections efficiently without excessive clicking.

4. **As a user**, I want to see basic metadata (score, author, comments) alongside headlines to help make informed decisions.

5. **As a user**, I want to proceed with only selected articles through the scraping and TTS pipeline.

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
- **hn_api.py**: Leverage existing `HackerNewsAPI.get_top_stories()` method
- **main.py**: Insert selection step between story fetching and article scraping in the pipeline
- **scraper.py**: Use existing `ArticleScraper.scrape_article()` method with filtered stories
- **tts_converter.py**: Use existing TTS conversion with selected content only

### Design Principles
- Maintain existing Clean Architecture patterns
- Follow established error handling and logging conventions
- Use Rich library for consistent CLI experience
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing pipeline commands
- Add new functionality as optional pipeline step

## Dependencies and Integration

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing `HackerNewsAPI` class for story fetching
- Existing `HackerCastPipeline` class for pipeline orchestration
- Rich library for console interface (already in use)
- Click library for CLI enhancements (already in use)

### External Dependencies
No new external dependencies required - feature uses existing libraries.

### Data Flow
1. **Story Fetching** → Stories fetched via existing `HackerNewsAPI`
2. **Selection Interface** → User interacts with Rich-powered selection UI
3. **Selection Processing** → Selected stories filtered and passed to existing scraper
4. **Pipeline Continuation** → Normal scraping and TTS conversion with selected subset

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test each component in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (Rich components, user input)
- Validate data model operations

### Integration Testing
- Test complete selection workflow
- Verify pipeline integration points
- Test CLI command functionality

### User Acceptance Testing
- Manual testing with various story sets
- Terminal compatibility testing
- Performance testing with different selection scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **Terminal Compatibility**: Different terminal emulators may behave differently
   - **Mitigation**: Test across common terminals, provide fallback modes

2. **User Input Handling**: Complex keyboard interaction handling
   - **Mitigation**: Use established Rich patterns, thorough input validation

3. **Performance**: Large story lists may impact interface responsiveness
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, lazy loading if needed

### Business Risks
1. **User Adoption**: Users may prefer automated selection
   - **Mitigation**: Make feature optional, maintain existing workflow

2. **Workflow Disruption**: Adding interactive step may slow down pipeline
   - **Mitigation**: Provide both interactive and automated modes

## Rollback Strategy

- Feature implemented as optional component
- Existing pipeline commands remain unchanged
- New functionality behind feature flags
- Can disable interactive mode via configuration
- Database/file changes minimal and backwards compatible

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] New feature coverage above 90%
- [ ] No performance regression in automated pipeline
- [ ] Interactive selection completes in under 2 minutes for 20 stories

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Selection interface loads in under 2 seconds
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works consistently
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- [ ] Graceful error handling and recovery

## Post-Implementation Tasks

1. **Monitoring**: Add telemetry to track feature usage
2. **Feedback Collection**: Gather user feedback on selection interface
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize selection performance
4. **Future Enhancements**: Plan integration with saved preferences, filters
5. **Documentation**: Update video tutorials and user guides

## Implementation Notes

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Rich Library**: Continue using Rich for consistent CLI experience
2. **Dataclass Pattern**: Follow existing patterns for data modeling
3. **Optional Integration**: Make interactive selection an optional pipeline step
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve all existing functionality

### Development Approach

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Each unit builds upon previous ones
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests alongside implementation
3. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on usability and keyboard efficiency
4. **Performance Conscious**: Consider responsiveness with large datasets

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow existing PEP 8 conventions
- Maintain docstring coverage
- Use type hints consistently
- Implement proper logging
- Handle errors gracefully

This plan provides a systematic approach to implementing the interactive article selection feature while maintaining the high quality and architectural consistency of the existing HackerCast codebase.
