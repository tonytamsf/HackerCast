      "content": "Fifty Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio üìª\n\nLast week, I went on an adventure through the electromagnetic spectrum!\n\nIt‚Äôs like an invisible world that always surrounds us, and allows us to do many amazing things: It‚Äôs how radio and TV are transmitted, it‚Äôs how we communicate using Wi-Fi or our phones. And there are many more things to discover there, from all over the world.\n\nIn this post, I‚Äôll show you fifty things you can find there ‚Äì all you need is this simple USB dongle and an antenna kit!\n\nA couple of years ago, I heard about the ‚ÄúMake 50 of Something‚Äù technique in Vi Hart‚Äôs Fifty Fizzbuzzes. Since then, I‚Äôve already made fifty programs for the fantasy console TIC-80 in one weekend in 2021.\n\nI found that a very exciting experience ‚Äì trying to make so many new things really pushed me to leave my comfort zone, to be creative, and not to get sucked into rabbit holes too deep.\n\nI knew I definitely wanted to try the technique again. So, when I took a week of vacation, I decided to try to find 50 things to do with a Software Defined Radio!\n\nWhat is an SDR?\n\nA Software Defined Radio is essentially a radio that relies on a computer to do most of its data processing. It doesn‚Äôt rely on analog hardware too much ‚Äì instead, most of what is does is ‚Äúdefined in software‚Äù, hence the name.\n\nUsually, SDRs can detect electromagnetic waves in a much wider range than a common FM radio, which makes it especially exciting! I got interested in SDRs after reading about Albert‚Äôs project to build one as a module for the Framework laptop!\n\nI went into this week without much knowledge of the things I‚Äôd find. I‚Äôd read through a introductory course for aspiring amateur radio operators (more on that later), but I barely knew which way to point my antenna.\n\nIf you want to follow along, this section is intended to help you get started!\n\nMost of the 50 things also have a little infobox at the beginning, explaining the frequencies, and some special knowledge needed to receive them.\n\nI looked into the topic a bit, and a popular, cheap SDR right now is the RTL-SDR Blog V4, which has the form factor of a simple SUB dongle. You can get it for around $30, or as a kit with telescopic antennas for $50.\n\nEverything I tried during this week was done using this USB dongle, the antenna kit, and a long piece of wire!\n\nI tried to adjust my antenna to the desired frequencies as best as I could. I think for receiving, it‚Äôs not super important that your antenna is perfectly configured, though.\n\nFor most applications, I used the dipole antennas that came with the kit I purchased. Dipole antennas have two sides that stick out the same length. You generally wanna make the whole antenna half as long as the wave length you want to receive, and orient it vertically.\n\nMy rule of thumb was to divide 72 by the frequency in MHz, and take that as the length of each side of the dipole in meters. That‚Äôd make the whole antenna a bit shorter than half of the wavelength.\n\nFor example, this is what the configuration looked like for frequencies around 100 MHz:\n\nAnd for higher frequencies, I used the tiny screw-on antennas from the kit:\n\nFor specific applications like receiving satellites, or receiving locators for airplanes, I used special configurations, but I‚Äôll discuss these as we go!\n\nThe software I liked best, and which I used for many things, was SDR++. It allows you to explore the frequency spectrum very smoothly, and has a modern user interface!\n\nBut I also used plenty of other software, on Linux in my case. I‚Äôll link to the software as needed below.\n\nOn Monday morning, I was excited to start this project! I sat down at my desk, and got to work!\n\nThis as an obvious first thing to do, as the signals are very strong! I was using the SDR++ software, and it felt very nice browsing around and discovering the stations around me! It reminded me of exploring the radio as a child.\n\nI found a local station that gives 1-hour slots to civic groups, for example!\n\nThis is a special frequency range in Germany: Anyone is allowed to send there, using licensed devices. There are 6 channels.\n\nI think someone was testing their device there when I listened in. :D I heard a ‚ÄúHellooo?‚Äù, then a ‚ÄúTest, test‚Äù, and then a ‚ÄúGeneral call to all stations‚Äù. Oh, and shortly after a short transmission on channel 3 in a Slavic-sounding language!\n\nFreenet devices have a range of only a couple of kilometers, so these people must have been pretty close! :O\n\nWhile browsing the aviation frequencies, I found this station that reports weather conditions in an endless loop. It seems to be the ‚ÄúAutomatic Terminal Information Service‚Äù of Hamburg airport!\n\nThanks to that, I found out that the current air pressure was 1011 hPa! :D\n\nListening to ‚Äúmessages not meant for the general public‚Äù is not allowed in Germany, so of course I didn‚Äôt do that. And if I had accidentally done that, I wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to tell you about it. üôÖ\n\nThat‚Äôs short for ‚ÄúAutomatic Dependent Surveillance ‚Äì Broadcast‚Äù. Aircraft send it automatically to be tracked.\n\nFor this, I built my first antenna! From wire and and an antenna connector called ‚ÄúSMA‚Äù.\n\nAnd it worked! \\o/ I decoded the signal using the software SDRangel. Fascinating! I saw some big & small airplanes, and even a helicopter!\n\nHow stereo audio is transmitted is really interesting, because it‚Äôs backwards-compatible to receivers that don‚Äôt support it:\n\nHere, you see the demodulated audio frequency spectrum, as shown in SDRangel. Below 19k Hz, it‚Äôs just mono audio. Then, to mark a stereo station, there‚Äôs a constant ‚Äúpilot tone‚Äù at 19k Hz! (Outside of what most humans can hear.)\n\nThen, if you double the frequency of the pilot tone, you can derive the sections where the difference of the left & right channel to the mono channel is transmitted!\n\nCorrection: I‚Äôve been told that instead of what I call ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù in this diagram, the upper frequencies transmit the difference of the left and right channels! That way, the receiver can calculate the left and right channels from the mono signal (which is, esseutially, the sum of left and right).\n\nIf you triple the frequency of the pilot tone, you get to a range where FM stations transmit small amounts of digital metadata, like the name and genre of the station, and the current song! That‚Äôs a protocol called Radio Data System.\n\nThis system can also transmit road traffic information! There seemed to be a road closure at ‚Äú0x64BE‚Äù, as decoded by SDRangel.\n\nThe Federal Highway Research Institute publishes an Excel table, where I could look up that this is a town in Lower Saxony!\n\n8: Listen to conversations on the 2-meter amateur radio band\n\nThis is a frequency range reserved for amateur radio operators ‚Äì for non-commercial use only. You may send on this band after getting a license.\n\nWhat I found here is seemingly a conversation circle facilitated by a relay around 15 km away from here ‚Äì it takes input on a certain frequency, and outputs an amplified copy of it on another frequency! Klaus, Bernd, J√ºrgen and Horst were talking about antennas, relays, and Windows XP! üòÅ\n\nThe SDRangel software also has a demodulator for Digital Audio Broadcast! :O I continue to be amazed by it!\n\nI think this was the first time I‚Äôve received digital radio via air! I saw so many stations, and I‚Äôve only checked a couple of channels.\n\nThe advantage of this digital channel is that there‚Äôs no noise. And I even saw a ‚Äúcover image‚Äù in one of the programs!\n\nThis is a frequency range for ‚ÄúPrivate Mobile Radio‚Äù. It‚Äôs another of these bands where anyone can transmit using a licensed device!\n\nNot a lot of activity here. I heard ‚ÄúHello, hellooo!‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan you hear me?‚Äù and some short transmissions that sounded like a child! :D\n\nThere also seemed to be digital transmissions, but I didn‚Äôt know how to decode them yet.\n\nThe range of PMR446 devices is pretty low (a couple of hundred metres in cities), so again, the people must‚Äôve been close!\n\nAfter the first day of SDR experiments, I was amazed how much invisible communication is going on around us in the electromagnetic spectrum at the same time!\n\nI posted each of these things on Mastodon as I went, and asked people for suggestions for more things I could receive.\n\nAt 433 MHz, there‚Äôs a frequency band for ‚Äúindustrial, scientific and medical‚Äù applications. And wow, there was quite a lot of activity nearby!\n\nUsing the decoder rtl_433, I saw two sensors that output the current temperature, humidity, and air pressure!\n\nThere were also some ‚ÄúIBIS beacons‚Äù flying by, which are used in public transportation, so maybe it‚Äôs buses driving by?\n\nLater, an ‚ÄúInterlogix Security‚Äù device also appeared, reporting ‚Äúclosed switch states‚Äù :O\n\nShips send out their status using AIS (Automatic Identification System). And again, I received a lot of them here in Hamburg! :O\n\nI was especially excited to receive data from the MS Stubnitz (a fisher boat that was turned into a culture center/techno club)! It reports its status as ‚Äúmoored‚Äù, and its speed as 0.1 knots! :D\n\nAgain, I used the software SDRangel. Apparently, it can also display a 3D map, but I haven‚Äôt figured out how to add 3D models‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¢ Frequency: 876-959 MHz, I looked up the specific ranges for Germany on Wikipedia\n\nI was curious whether you could tell if someone used their phone! So I borrowed a GSM phone, tuned to the correct frequencies, and made some test calls.\n\nWhat surprised me most: You can kind of ‚Äúsee‚Äù the volume at which I was talking!?\n\nIn the recording, the three dense bands at the end were when I was humming into the phone at the other end. This only worked in the ‚Äúreceiving‚Äù direction.\n\nI spent all Tuesday afternoon and evening learning about satellites. The program gpredict is really nice to find out when satellites will pass overhead! I learned a lot, including that one satellite I was trying to receive burned up last week! :D\n\nI was super excited when I first received a signal from a NOAA satellite! üõ∞Ô∏è\n\nBut I didn‚Äôt manage to decode it properly yet. Maybe my reception was too noisy? I wanted to keep trying, but I had to move on.\n\nIn Germany, the police has switched to an encrypted digital protocol called TETRA.\n\nEven though I‚Äôve seen some interesting talks at CCC events about weaknesses in the decryption, all I wanted to do for now is looking at the pretty signals in SDR++. :3\n\nAgain, this is communication not meant for the general public.\n\nI didn‚Äôt listen to someone dispatching taxis to specific addresses, and you also shouldn‚Äôt do that either. üöï\n\nSome of the most fun I had was just browsing frequencies and seeing what I can find! Sometimes, I encountered signals I can‚Äôt identify.\n\nFor example, at 865-868 MHz, there was a family of slow, continuous, digital signals that made a nice melody when listened to in single-sideband demodulation!\n\nAnd at 177-180 MHz, there were two very broadband transmissions. Might be TV? But I couldn‚Äôt find out what type. (It later turned out that I‚Äôd already listened to these signals ‚Äì it was digital radio, DAB+.)\n\nAs I was browsing around for things to receive, I saw on this tracking website that a radiosonde was just launched in Hamburg! SDRangel could decode its transmission! It had climbed to a height of 7 km, and it‚Äôs -17 ¬∞C there!\n\nI knew that it would eventually burst and fall back to Earth, and that I could try to get to it and find it!\n\nI decided to go on a field trip, using trains and my bike.\n\nI was following the tracker. The balloon popped earlier than predicted, and I frantically changed travel plans!\n\nEventually, it landed in a forest. I hoped I could get to it! What made this adventure more tricky was that my mobile Internet contract ran out while I was on the go, and my battery was also almost empty.\n\nBut I made it to the forest, and entered it.\n\nAs I circled the site, I encountered a person in their 60s, with a stubbly beard and a blue wool hat. He was looking in the direction of the crash site, and was holding a smartphone, so I asked him whether he also was looking for the radiosonde.\n\nHe was! We looked for it together for half an hour, jumping over small rivers and crawling through the woods, while he gave me a lot of tips related to hunting sondes.\n\nHe told me that he had found around 40 of them so far!\n\nUsually, the sondes keep broadcasting after landing, but this one wasn‚Äôt. So he quickly guessed that someone else could‚Äôve taken it. Or maybe it landed in the water and died?\n\nSome pictures of the area we searched:\n\nEventually, we gave up, and walked back to our vehicles. He also is an amateur radio operator, and could answer a couple of questions related to building antennas!\n\nAnd he was right: Someone had been faster than us! The status was changed. So in the end, I didn‚Äôt find the sonde. But something that might be even better ‚Äì a friend!\n\nIn the 2-meter amateur band, there are certain frequencies for the ‚ÄúAutomatic Packet Reporting System‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bit like IP ‚Äì packets have a ‚Äúfrom‚Äù and a ‚Äúto‚Äù. They can also broadcast their position, or weather data.\n\nSome stations seem to announce themselves as repeaters, which probably help forward the packets to increase the range.\n\nAnd two people seemed to be on a ‚Äúfieldday‚Äù, and broadcasted their location. :D\n\nI started the day by building an antenna!\n\nThis was going to be a simple ‚Äúrandom wire‚Äù antenna, to allow me to get better reception in the lower frequencies, which I‚Äôve omitted so far (because I knew it would be much more fun with a better antenna)!\n\nI measured out 21.6 m of wire (which for ‚ú®magic‚ú® reasons seem to be a good universal antenna length)‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶directly attached it to the center of another SMA connector‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶and draped it all around my room!\n\nPeople on the Internet say that there are many problems with this ‚Äì that it would be better to have it outside, and that there‚Äôs an impedance mismatch between the receiver and the wire.\n\nI could address those problems, but I wanna try how well this works first :)\n\nI‚Äôd been learning it a little bit, so if I recorded it and slowed it down, I could understand it: They‚Äôre sending their callsigns. These are from Belgium, France, and Italy! \\o/\n\nI compared to my 2-meter dipole antenna, and the reception was definitely better ‚Äì I can pick up more transmissions, and with much less noise!\n\nThe German Weather Service broadcasts maritime information throughout the day on various shortwave frequencies.\n\nThey use a protocol called RTTY (radioteletype), and it took me a while to decode it. But I found a neat little program called ‚Äúfldigi‚Äù: You can pipe audio to it (single side band modulation), and then if you pick the correct settings (see screenshot), it happily transcribes the messages!\n\nHere‚Äôs the station weather reports for the Baltic Sea and Northern Sea!\n\nI found some other strange signals on the 30-meter band. The Signal Identification Wiki was really helpful for figuring out what they were: FT8!\n\nFT8 is quite a new protocol, invented in 2017, and it seems to be super popular right now! It allows you to transmit short messages, and again, people are looking for people to talk to (CQ), saying how well they receive each other, or saying goodbye (73).\n\nThis is the WSJT-X software.\n\n24: Detect whether your notebook is charging\n\nAs I was browsing the very low-frequency bands, I had a strange problem: Sometimes, that would work okayish, sometimes I could even make out voices!\n\nBut other times, it wouldn‚Äôt work at all, and everything would be loud, angry noise. Even in regions where I had better reception before!\n\nEventually, I found out how to solve that issue ‚Äì by unplugging my notebook charger. D‚Äôoh! :D\n\nIn the low frequencies, occasionally, you can hear a short chirp! :D These are caused by ionosondes, scientific instruments which measure the properties of the ionosphere by sweeping a wide frequency spectrum.\n\nAnother signal (which I accidentally got in the same screenshot) is a radar system ‚Äì in this case, according to the Signal Identification Wiki, it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúCODAR‚Äù system, used to measure the motion of water waves and currents along coasts! :O\n‚Ä¢ Frequency: In all amateur bands, especially the ones below 30 MHz\n\nHow do you transmit speech over long distances? You can use ‚Äúamplitude modulation‚Äù, where you change the volume of the carrier frequency to model your audio.\n\nAs a side effect, the bands to the sides of the carrier will contain a signal, as well.\n\nOne trick is to transmit just those sidebands, which saves power! But you have to ‚Äúguess‚Äù the base frequency when listening. Depending on which part you transmit, this is called ‚Äúlower side band‚Äù or ‚Äúupper side band‚Äù.\n\nSDR++ makes it very easy to play with this! :) Here‚Äôs someone from Serbia!\n\n28: Listen to AM radio from the other side of the world\n\nAt night, low-frequency radio waves can travel further around the world, because they‚Äôre reflected by the layers of the ionosphere! There‚Äôs something magical about this.\n\nI put my antenna outside, and I could hear a lot of broadcasting stations! On short-wave.info, you can look up where they are located.\n\nSome stations in China are broadcasting with very high power! Some I could hear were over 7500 km away.\n\nOriginally, I had planned the project to run from Monday to Friday. When I still had 32 things to do in Friday morning, I knew I‚Äôd need to extend it. But I hadn‚Äôt run out of ideas yet:\n\nAfter I‚Äôd looked into the low frequencies on Thursday, I went to a higher band again: The Citizens Band!\n\nThis is the third frequency band I‚Äôm aware of where anyone is allowed to transmit ‚Äì provided that you use a licensed device!\n\nThis is a band where my random wire antenna really came in handy. Without it, I would have had a hard time understanding anything. And even with it, transmissions are extremely noisy.\n\nCB radio is used internationally, especially by truck drivers, it seems.\n\n30: Assess the propagation of radio waves using beacons\n\nThe International Beacon Project runs a network of 18 stations, which take turns transmitting their callsigns at certain frequencies.\n\nUsing this system, you can quickly get a sense of how well radio waves are currently propagating to your location. Clever!\n\nI picked up the beacon from southern Finland! You can see its callsign scrolling away in the video. It‚Äôs followed by four dashes send with decreasing power. I only heard the first one‚Ä¶\n\nI would‚Äôve loved to receive DCF77, which powers the radio clocks in Germany! But no matter how hard I listened to 77.5 kHz, there was nothing there. I don‚Äôt think my dongle can do that.\n\nSo I used higher frequencies! Russia transmits its ‚ÄúRWM‚Äù time signal at 9996 kHz, which beeps every second, with a long beep for the full minute.\n\nNot enough to tell the time, but enough to adjust your wrist watch, I guess!\n‚Ä¢ Frequency: 3855, 7880, and 13882.5 kHz (see weatherfax.com for more)\n\nThe German Weather Service broadcasts weather maps throughout the day! You can decode them using fldigi‚Äôs ‚ÄúWEFAX-576‚Äù setting.\n\nI caught this one only halfway through. According to the schedule, it‚Äôs the ‚ÄúSurface weather chart North Atlantic, Europe‚Äù!\n\nIf you squint really hard, you can make out the coast of Spain and the Mediterranean Sea on the right side!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt stop trying to capture a weather satellite, it‚Äôs just too cool to receive an image from space!\n\nThat evening, an American satellite called NOAA-15 passed right over us, so I thought I‚Äôd try again. And this time, I got parts of an image! \\o/\n\nThis is real-time data! At night, both transmitted images are infrared recordings.\n\nI recorded the FM signal using SDR++, and then decoded the image using noaa-apt, which also added country outlines.\n\nHere‚Äôs what the NOAA-15 weather satellite sounds like, by the way! tick-tock\n\nWhile recording, I noticed something strange: The transmission didn‚Äôt happen at the frequency I had expected it to! And also, the frequency changed.\n\nThen it hit me: Doppler effect! At the time of the recording, the frequency was around 4250 Hz higher than expected.\n\nAfter looking up the formula, I calculated a relative speed of 9 km/s! (Which got close to its real speed, 7.5 km/s.)\n\nThese stations send encrypted messages using number sequences, possibly for espionage purposes!\n\nSo why not listen to one? There‚Äôs a surprisingly well-maintained database of them on a site call Priyom.\n\nSo I tuned into the next frequency that was listed, and: Bingo!\n\nAllegedly, this was a station in Moscow. That day, it sent ‚Äú218, 218, 218‚Äù in a loop, followed by three long beeps, which is the format of a ‚Äúnull message‚Äù.\n\nSo no news for the Russian spies.\n\nThe week was really intense for me. Initially, I thought I‚Äôd do 10 things per day, but it turned out that that was too much. I had to learn so many new things.\n\nMany things I tried don‚Äôt work on my first attempt. Finding LoRaWAN signals, decoding packet radio, finding something on PMR446, decoding the satellite ‚Äì those were all things that required a second (or third) attempt.\n\nThis project was exhausting, but also joyful ‚Äì having committed to it, I got in a nice flow state, where I could focus on it for hours.\n\nOften, I thought: ‚ÄúOkay, this is it. I can‚Äôt possibly find more things.‚Äù But this is the power of the 50 Things technique: I have to keep looking, leave my comfort zone, be creative, try things I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have tried!\n‚Ä¢ Frequency: 14.230, 14.233, 21.340, 28.680, 145.625 MHz seem to be popular\n\nUsing a protocol called ‚ÄúSSTV‚Äù (slow-scan television), amateur radio operators send each other postcards! :D\n\nI‚Äôve been browsing the usual frequencies, and tried to decode images using the software QSSTV on Linux. And I accidentally caught a piece of what seems to be a test image!\n\nThere‚Äôs a mysterious Russian station broadcasting at 4625 kHz. Sometimes, it sends encrypted voice messages.\n\nBut usually, all it does is send a honking sound every two seconds, to deter other stations from using the same frequency.\n\nThe purpose of the station is unclear, but most theories think it‚Äôs military communication.\n\nThis was a bit like trying to catch a rare insect! üêõ\n\nLoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol, intended for ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù applications.\n\nYou can see transmission in the lower half of the screenshot! It has a very cute structure: You can see eight ‚Äúdown-chirps‚Äù, followed by two ‚Äúup-chirps‚Äù. That‚Äôs the header, followed by the payload.\n\nTo look for the signal, I made a ‚Äúbaseband capture‚Äù in SDR++, and opened the recording in Sonic Visualizer.\n\nDevices like smoke detectors or meters for water or heat are sending their readings via a protocol called Wireless M-Bus.\n\nAgain, I was surprised by how many devices seem to be around! Thanks for the tip, @envy :)\n\nwmbusmeters is a really nice tool for decoding the messages.\n\nThe chips in my SDR stick are also being used in DVB-T dongles! So, can we watch TV? Unfortunately, no.\n\nFrom what I pieced together, there‚Äôs a difference between using the stick in SDR mode (where it sends the full spectrum), and in TV mode (where it sends the decoded video).\n\nIn Germany, there‚Äôs now DVB-T2, which my hardware doesn‚Äôt support in TV mode. And in SDR mode, the bandwidth is too narrow for DVB-T2. But we can scroll over a channel and look at it! :3\n\nDid a little walk to a big intersection, to see what ‚Äúdevice signals‚Äù I‚Äôd find there at 433 MHz.\n\nI could confirm that the IBIS beacons are in fact being sent by buses! The included ‚Äúvehicle ID‚Äù even matches the white number that‚Äôs printed on it.\n\nI also saw some messages from tire pressure monitoring systems in cars! They also include an ID, and usually, the brand of the car! The owners probably aren‚Äôt aware how easy it would be to track them‚Ä¶ (Thanks, @scy!)\n\nSide note: I wonder why some signals in that band are warped like the one at 433.96 MHz here!\n\nAt first, I thought ‚ÄúAh, Doppler effect again, it‚Äôs coming from a moving car!‚Äù But if that‚Äôd be the case, that car would be moving at over 700 m/s‚Ä¶\n\nFriends later suspected that this effect is due to weak batteries affecting the crystal in the sending devices, or temperature changes.\n\nSo I caught a satellite again! :D This time, it was school project, the Italian satellite ‚ÄúMax Valier‚Äù. It continuously sends Morse code on a beacon frequency.\n\nPretty weak signal, but here‚Äôs what I could hear:\n\nSuper happy about this! I got both the name of the satellite, as well as its callsign at the end, and what seems to be some kind of greeting? I later learned that is Morse code shorthand for ‚Äúand‚Äù, and that Manfred and Christa Fuchs were the founders of a company that helped launch the satellite!\n\nThis is another thing that‚Äôs not allowed in Germany, so you shouldn‚Äôt do it.\n\nPagers use a format called ‚ÄúPOCSAG‚Äù (Post Office Code Standardisation Advisory Group‚Ä¶), which you should not decode using multimon-ng.\n\nBecause you would find that the content is short and cryptic anyway. It would probably be repeated by several stations all around you, to make sure the whole region is covered.\n\nDo not read the English Wikipedia page! It contains frequencies!\n\nAt this point, I was pretty tired. Focusing on this project for 6 days straight took a lot of energy, and I was always uncertain if I could actually complete all 50 things in that week! But I woke up with a fun idea:\n\n44: Detect when a smartphone is turned on\n\nI was curious whether I could see the NFC transceiver in my smartphone! And yeah, especially using my random wire antenna, this works really well!\n\nMy smartphone seems to emit at the NFC frequency a couple of times per second. And when unlocking the screen, it emits five very strong beeps on that frequency! I can see those from the other side of our apartment.\n\nSurely, these signals are the same for every device, right? üò∂\n\nObserve the five beeps here:\n\nPiko and I played around with NFC a bit more, and we found out that when getting close to an NFC tag, a smartphone emits at 13.56 MHz continuously!\n\nSo, we started sending Morse code to each other between rooms, using a smartphone and a library book! :‚ÄôD\n\nSeems that the shortest signal you can create is 0.7 s long, resulting in a meager communication speed of 3-4 words per minute‚Ä¶\n\nThere are ground stations that emit a signal that allow calculating your angle relative to it! If you receive two, you can determine your position. (Thanks, @fly_it!)\n\nI heard the one close to Hamburg! And SDRangel has a decoder, of course! It calculated angles between 210¬∞ and 230¬∞, which is pretty close to the actual value of 224¬∞! I don‚Äôt think they are meant to be used from the ground.\n\nThe neat navigational map is from https://skyvector.com!\n\nI spent ages trying to build my own decoder in GNU Radio. But I wasn‚Äôt familiar with it at all, and I eventually gave up. Still, that seems to be the software you wanna learn for tasks like these!\n\nBy the way, how the ground stations work is fascinating: In my case, it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúDoppler VOR‚Äù: It transmits a static frequency via amplitude modulation, and adds another signal that moves around in circles, so you get a Doppler frequency shift.\n\nIf you compare the two, you can calculate the angle!\n\n47: See how low you can go in the frequency spectrum\n\nThis was a fun exploration: What‚Äôs the lowest-frequency broadcast I can receive?\n\nThe RTL-SDR Blog V4 stick I‚Äôm using has a neat feature ‚Äì a built-in ‚Äúupconverter‚Äù, which is enabled automatically when you try to listen to frequencies below what the chipset supports. This allows it to receive down to ~500 kHz!\n\nThe first stations that are comprehensible started at 1 MHz for me.\n\n48: See how high you can go in the frequency spectrum\n\nThe chipset in my SDR stick go up to maximum frequency of 1766 MHz. It seems pretty quiet up there, probably because I lack proper antennas. I found these three lines in an amateur band, but they probably originate from the stick itself, or another device.\n\nSo the highest-frequency thing I‚Äôve received is ADS-B at 1090 MHz (see entry #5)! üéâ\n\nWe‚Äôve been over this. Not allowed in Germany. Don‚Äôt do it. ‚õî\n\nBut if you‚Äôre in the US, anyone can purchase a marine radio, and even use it to transmit! :D\n\nJust now, I was wondering whether there are any Android apps for controlling SDRs.\n\nAnd it turned out, the software I liked best that week, SDR++, had an Android version since a couple of weeks! \\o/\n\nSo now I could go track down the source of some of these strange signals! :3\n\nAnd with that, ‚Ä¶ ü•Å ‚Ä¶ I was officially done with my ‚Äú50 things to do with a software defined radio‚Äù! üéâ\n\nThis were seven very intense days, where I learned a lot of new things about radio waves and the many things they can be used for!\n\nI was proud! I was tired! I was amazed that all those things I received are all around us, everywhere, all at once ‚Äì if you know where to look. :O\n\nHere‚Äôs some things that I haven‚Äôt tried or that haven‚Äôt worked:\n‚Ä¢ Receiving digital voice modes (SDRangel should be able to do it, but I couldn‚Äôt figure it out)\n‚Ä¢ Receive something from the ISS\n‚Ä¢ Use the GRAVES radar to detect meteors (couldn‚Äôt detect it)\n\nAlso, doing things with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Zigbee could be fun, but I‚Äôd need a more expensive receiver for those frequencies.\n\nSo, was this project in fact a gateway drug to getting an amateur radio license?\n\nYeah, probably. I‚Äôd love to transmit something and experiment more! :D\n\nIn Germany, a new license class will be introduced in summer 2024, that‚Äôll allow you to send on the 10-meter, 2-meter and 70-cm bands (the ‚ÄúN class‚Äù).\n\nIn fact, there‚Äôs a really good German online course that teaches you everything you need to know: 50ohm.de\n\nHighly recommended, even if you‚Äôre not planning on getting a license.\n\nFinally, thanks to Piko, Chris, and Cqoicebordel for proof-reading this blog post! <3\n\nYou can add your comment in the Fediverse!

      "title": "How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter",
      "content": "Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the Framework desktop PC. If you've missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it's because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the AMD Ryzen AI Max APU, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.\n\nAs a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our NF-A12x25 fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures ‚Äì you can read more about this here. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply.\n\nIt must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.\n\nIn combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.\n\nWhile the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.\n\nBoth the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at Printables.com for you to 3D-print at home:\n‚Ä¢ Custom fan duct to make best use of the custom side panel\n\nFortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.\n\nIn addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional NF-A8 PWM fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it‚Äôs not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.\n\nWhile upgrading to an NF-A12x25 G2 does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the ‚ÄûG1‚Äú fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the NF-A12x25 G2 if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.\n\nIn summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the Framework Desktop‚Äôs cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.",
