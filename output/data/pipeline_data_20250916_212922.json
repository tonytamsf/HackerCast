Embed links converted to Markdown format and placed in the user's defined attachment location (Settings → File & links)\n• Provide working test cases, ideally a reproducible data import that can be used on Notion. Alternatively a test account you can share with us via DM.\n\nSome exploration is required before implementation because Databases and Bases work a bit differently. Notion's Databases start out as empty, whereas a Base starts out with all of the user's files, then narrows down using filters.\n• Determine for importing files, and the bases/views\n• Determine what can be imported: views, columns, groups, summaries, formulas, etc.",
