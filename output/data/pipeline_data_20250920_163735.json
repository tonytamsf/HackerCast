The WeAct Display FS V1 may be tiny, but it’s also a full-color 160×80 resolution display that can be customized with software provided by WeAct.\nText and image on display for illustration only.

The first one is the WeAct Studio System Monitor based on a fork of Matthieu Houdebine’s Turing Smart Screen Python project. This allows users to create UIs/themes with text, images, weather, and other features… WeAct says the little device only works on Windows, but the open-source project is supposed to also work on macOS, Linux (including Raspberry Pi OS), and essentially any operating system with support for Python 3.9+.\nWeAct Studio System Monitor\nThe second program is called WeAct Studio Screen Projection, and as I understand it, it emulates an actual display, so you could move any window/program to the USB display.  I’m just not sure how a desktop OS like Windows will handle a tiny 160×80 “monitor”… I suppose it could be used to play a full-screen YouTube video or display photos for whatever reason. That one only works on Windows, and there’s no source code.\nWeAct Studio Screen Projection\nYou’ll find the WeAct Display FS V1 (0.96-inch) on AliExpress for about $2 plus shipping, but while looking for information, I also noticed a 3.5-inch variant with 480×320 resolution for about $11.\nJean-Luc Aufranc (CNXSoft)Jean-Luc started CNX Software in 2010 as a part-time endeavor, before quitting his job as a software engineering manager, and starting to write daily news, and reviews full time later in 2011.\nShare this:\nSupport CNX Software!

      "title": "A brief history of threads and threading",
      "content": "The original 128K Mac from 1984 came with a single Motorola 68000 processor running at 8 MHz that could only run one app at a time. Yet today’s Macs come with multiple CPU cores that can comfortably run several substantial apps simultaneously, while running a Time Machine backup and other tasks in the background. This brief history outlines the journey between them.\nA processor with a single core and no support for multi-tasking runs one sequence of instructions at a time. When those call for an operating system function to be performed, the running app is interrupted to hand control over to the system, and once that has completed, control is passed back to the app. That’s what the first Macs did until Andy Hertzfeld wrote Switcher, released by Apple in April 1985. This allowed the user to switch between running more than one app, but was still limited to running just one of them at a time.\nMultitasking\nOver the next couple of years, some third-party utilities were produced to go further than Switcher, but it wasn’t until 1987 that MultiFinder replaced Switcher, and was integrated into System 7 in 1991. Developed by Erich Ringewald and Phil Goldman, this brought cooperative multitasking, which was to become the mainstay of classic Mac OS.\nIn computers with a single processor core, multitasking is a way of cheating to give the impression that the processor is doing several things at once, when in fact all it’s doing is switching rapidly between two or more different programs. There are two fundamental models for doing that:\ncooperative multitasking, in which individual tasks yield to give others processing time;\npreemptive multitasking, in which a scheduler switches between tasks at regular intervals.\nWhen a processor switches from one task to the next, the current task state must be saved so it can be resumed later. Once that’s complete, the next task is loaded to complete the context switch. That incurs overhead, both in terms of processing and in memory storage, which are less when switching between lightweight tasks. Different strategies have been adopted to determine the optimum size of tasks and overhead imposed by context switching, and terminology differs between them, variously using words such as processes, threads and even fibres, which can prove thoroughly confusing.\nClassic Mac OS thus has a Process Manager that launches apps in cooperative multitasking. This works well much of the time, but lets badly behaved tasks hog the processor and block other tasks from getting their fair share. It’s greatly aided by the main event loop at the heart of Mac apps that waits for control input to direct the app to perform work for the user. But when an app charges off to spend many seconds tackling a demanding task without polling its main event loop, that app could lock the user out for what seems like an age.\nIn February 1988 Apple released the first Unix for Macintosh, A/UX, which came with preemptive multitasking. That was added to Mac OS in 1996 in System 7.5.3, in Multiprocessing Services, and further enhanced in Mac OS 8.6 three years later. Cooperative multitasking was also supported by the Thread Manager.\nThreads\nIn 2000 Apple’s hardware and software changed radically. Its first Macs with dual processors came in PowerPC 7400 (G4) chips in Power Mac G4 desktop systems, and Mac OS X brought several types of thread that could be used to manage processing on multiple processors or CPU cores, together with preemptive multitasking. Thread types include low-level Mach threads, higher-level POSIX threads or Pthreads that replaced Multiprocessing Services, Java Threads, Cocoa’s NSThreads, and cooperatively scheduled threads using the Carbon Thread Manager. The following diagram summarises Apple’s current terminology.\nIn most cases, we’re considering applications with a GUI, normally run from a bundle structure. These can in turn run their own code, such as privileged helper apps used to perform work that requires elevated privileges. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of additional executable code associated with many apps.\nWhen that app is run, there’s a single runtime instance created from its single executable code, and given its own virtual memory and access to system resources that it needs. This is a process, and listed as such in Activity Monitor, for example.\nEach process has a main thread, a single flow of code execution, and may create additional threads, perhaps to run in the background. Threads don’t get their own virtual memory, but share that allocated to the process, although they have their own stack. On Apple silicon Macs they’re easy to tell apart as they can only run on a single core, although they may be moved between cores, sometimes rapidly.\nWithin each thread are individual tasks, each a quantity of work to be performed. These can be brief sections of code and are more interdependent than threads. They’re often divided into synchronous and asynchronous tasks, depending on whether they need to be run as part of a strict sequence.\nIn 2005 the Power Mac G5 was the first Mac to use dual-core PowerPC G5 processors, then the iMac 17-inch of the following year used Apple’s first Intel Core Duo processor with two cores.\nGrand Central Dispatch\nIn 2009 Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard introduced a new dispatcher, named Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) after Grand Central Terminal in New York City, and that was enhanced in macOS Sierra a decade later. More recently it has been referred to simply as Dispatch.\nAt its heart, GCD is a dispatcher managing queues of tasks, activating those that need most to be run, and leaving the less pressing to wait a bit longer. It has its own queues, as well as those assembled by apps. Some are run as simple queues with a first in first out rule, others using sophisticated heuristics to determine relative priorities. There’s a detailed account of GCD internals in Jonathan Levin’s book *OS Internals volume 1, and Apple’s current developer documentation is here.\nGCD was introduced for Macs with multiple identical cores, to support their symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), and with the release of the first Apple silicon Macs in November 2020 it has managed queues of threads to be dispatched for execution on two CPU core types, Performance and Efficiency. Core allocation is now managed according to the Quality of Service (QoS) assigned to each thread. When used on SMP processors with no contention for core availability, QoS has limited effects on thread performance, but performance on P and E cores may differ by a factor of 10.\nOver the last 41 years, macOS has gained thorough support for getting the best performance from multiple tasks, threads, and processes in chips that contain up to 32 CPU cores of two types – a far cry from that single 68000 processor.\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nPinterest\nClick to share on Threads (Opens in new window)\nThreads\nClick to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)\nMastodon\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nBluesky\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nLike Loading...\nRelated",

In November 2024, federal prosecutors indicted four men, aged 20 to 23, in connection with similar cyber attacks, though those charges were not formally linked to the MGM and Caesars incidents.\nLVMPD’s latest statement did not name MGM Resorts International or Caesars Entertainment directly, instead referring to “multiple Las Vegas casino properties” targeted between August and October 2023.\nCybersecurity experts have attributed the attacks to a loosely organized hacker group known as Scattered Spider, which also operates under aliases such as Octo Tempest, UNC3944 and 0ktapus3.\nMGM reportedly refused to pay a ransom, resulting in an estimated $100 million in losses and roughly 10 days of system outages affecting reservations, slot machines, room keys and websites.

      "title": "Teardown of Apple 40W dynamic power adapter with 60W max",
      "content": "Introduction\nOn September 10th, Apple held its 2025 Fall Event, unveiling the iPhone 17 lineup alongside a brand-new product category—iPhone Air. Among the announcements, one product that stood out was Apple’s new 40W Dynamic Power Adapter, which gained attention for its compact design and ability to dynamically deliver up to 60W of total output power.\nThe charger is now available on Apple’s official website, priced at $39 USD. According to Apple, when used with an iPhone 17 series device, the adapter can charge the phone to 50% in approximately 20 minutes—offering significantly faster charging performance compared to the previous generation. Despite the substantial power upgrade, the adapter maintains a highly compact form factor—roughly the same size as Apple’s standard 20W charger. It also features foldable prongs for improved portability and travel convenience. In the following teardown, we take a closer look at the internal design and power distribution architecture of Apple’s latest fast charger.\nProduct Appearance\nThe front of the packaging features the Apple logo, product name, and an image of the adapter.\nThe back of the packaging displays a simplified diagram of the adapter and its ports, along with CE certification and other information.\nOne side of the packaging has a specification label attached.\nThe opposite side features a label indicating the manufacturing date and \"Made in China\" origin.\nThe packaging includes the charger along with the user manual and other documentation.\nThe charger is wrapped in protective paper.\nIt features a design similar to the 35W dual USB-C charger (model A2579).\nThe small recessed areas on both sides of the body facilitate easy plugging and unplugging.\nThe output side features a single USB-C port with a white plastic insert.\nThe bottom is printed with specification details.\nModel: A3365\nInput: 100-240V\\~ 50/60Hz 1.5A (USB PD)\nOutput: (AVS) 15-20V 2A \\[3.0A DPS] or (AVS) 9-15V 2.67A \\[3.0A DPS] or 9V 3A or 5V 3A\nMaximum total output power: 60W LPS\nThe charger has passed CCC certification and Level VI energy efficiency certification.\nIt features foldable prongs.\nThe length of the charger is about 45.72 mm (1.8 inches).\nThe width is about 45.73 mm (1.8 inches).\nThe thickness is about 28.11 mm (1.11 inches).\nIts size is nearly identical to that of the Apple 20W charger.\nIt is slightly smaller than the 35W dual USB-C charger.\nThat's how big it is in the hand.\nThe weight is about 80 g (2.82 oz).\nChargerLAB POWER-Z KM003C shows that it supports PD3.0 and DCP charging protocols.\nAnd it has four fixed PDOs of 5V3A, 9V3A, 15V2.67A, and 20V2A.\nWhen used to charge the iPhone 16 Pro Max, the charging power is about 27.23W.\nWhen charging the MacBook Air M3 2024, the charging power is about 55.94W, successfully activating the 60W dynamic fast charging feature.\nTeardown\nNext, let's take it apart to see its internal components and structure.\nRemove the bottom casing, and it is revealed that the enclosure uses a combination of snap-fit clips and ultrasonic welding for sealing.\nThe input side features a contact-based power delivery design.
