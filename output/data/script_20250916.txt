Welcome to HackerCast, your daily digest of the top stories from Hacker News. Today is September 16, 2025, and we have 2 fascinating stories to share with you.

Story 1: GNU Midnight Commander
GNU Midnight Commander (or ) is a visual, dual-pane file manager. It is released under the GNU General Public License and therefore qualifies as Free Software.

Midnight Commander is a feature-rich, full-screen, text-mode application that allows you to copy, move, and delete files and entire directory trees, search for files, and execute commands in the subshell. Internal viewer, editor and diff viewer are included.

uses versatile text interface libraries such as ncurses or S-Lang, which allows it to work on a regular console, inside an X Window terminal, over connections, and in all kinds of remote shells.

The easiest way to install is to use your system package manager:

Our source releases are kindly mirrored by OSU OSL. Our canonical repository is hosted on GitHub. See the Source code page for details.

The primary way to learn about is to use the context-sensitive online help available via .

Story 2: Notion API importer, with Databases to Bases conversion bounty
Currently Importer supports Notion imports via the HTML export #14. This new importer would use the Notion API and download files progressively. This would also add support for Databases to Bases conversion. See #415

See the Contribution guidelines for how to claim this bounty.

Please only apply if you have taken time to explore the Importer codebase, as well as the Notion API. Provide detail about how you would approach solving it within the constraints of this Obsidian plugin.
• Uses Notion API (integration token) incorporating changes from new data source object introduced 2025-09.
• Support for images and attachments. Embed links converted to Markdown format and placed in the user's defined attachment location (Settings → File & links)
• Provide working test cases, ideally a reproducible data import that can be used on Notion. Alternatively a test account you can share with us via DM.

Some exploration is required before implementation because Databases and Bases work a bit differently. Notion's Databases start out as empty, whereas a Base starts out with all of the user's files, then narrows down using filters.
• Determine for importing files, and the bases/views
• Determine what can be imported: views, columns, groups, summaries, formulas, etc.

That wraps up today's HackerCast. Thank you for listening, and we'll see you tomorrow with more stories from the world of technology.
