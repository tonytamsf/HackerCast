Chloe: Welcome to HackerCast, your daily dose of what's trending on Hacker News.
David: Hello, Chloe, and hello to our listeners. Today, we're diving into the top four stories making waves today, September 17, 2025.
Chloe: Sounds like a jam-packed show, David! Let's jump right in. Our first story is about Slack dramatically increasing costs for a non-profit, Hack Club. What's going on there?
David: Exactly, Chloe. Hack Club, a non-profit providing coding education to teenagers, received a notice from Slack that their bill would increase by $195,000 *per year*. Apparently, if they didn't agree to pay, Slack threatened to deactivate their workspace and delete all of their message history.

Chloe: Wow, that sounds pretty harsh. So, they were already paying, right?
David: Yes, they were already paying $5,000 a year, which they considered reasonable. It was the sudden and massive increase that caught them off guard and made them decide to move away from Slack.
Chloe: So what did they end up doing?
David: Hack Club decided to migrate to Mattermost, emphasizing the importance of owning their data. They’re advising other small businesses to consider doing the same. The sudden notice also caused huge disruptions, forcing staff to scramble and migrate years of institutional knowledge.
Chloe: That sounds like a huge headache. Okay, let’s move on. The next story is about WASM 3.0 being completed. David, for our listeners who might not be familiar, what is WASM and why is a new version a big deal?
David: WASM, or WebAssembly, is essentially a low-level bytecode format that allows code to run in web browsers (and elsewhere) with near-native performance. WASM 3.0 is a significant update introducing several big features, like a 64-bit address space.
Chloe: 64-bit address space? That sounds complicated. What does that mean in plain English?
David: It means WASM applications can now access a much larger amount of memory – theoretically up to 16 exabytes compared to the previous 4 gigabytes. This is especially useful for non-web applications that need to handle very large datasets.
Chloe: Got it. So, more memory means bigger and better applications? What else is new in WASM 3.0?
David: There are a bunch of other significant improvements, including support for multiple memories within a single module, garbage collection, typed references, tail calls, and exception handling. They've also added relaxed vector instructions to squeeze out more performance and a deterministic profile for applications needing reproducible execution, like blockchains. Finally, there is also custom annotation syntax.

Chloe: Garbage collection? That’s something I only ever hear about in Java.
David: Exactly. Before, managing memory manually in WASM could be tricky. Now, WASM runtimes can automatically handle allocating and freeing memory, which simplifies things for developers and makes it easier to compile languages with garbage collection to WASM.
Chloe: So, it’s making WASM more versatile and developer-friendly. Sounds like a big step forward. Let's move on to our third story. It's about the Orange Pi RV2, a $40 RISC-V single-board computer. What exactly is RISC-V, and why is this significant?
David: RISC-V is an open-source hardware instruction set architecture. It’s an alternative to more proprietary architectures like ARM and x86. The Orange Pi RV2 is exciting because it offers a low-cost entry point into the RISC-V ecosystem.
Chloe: So, like a Raspberry Pi, but with a different kind of processor? What's the target audience for this thing?
David: Exactly. It's designed for developers, hobbyists, and industry professionals interested in exploring RISC-V for things like IoT projects and lightweight AI. While it's not powerful enough to replace a desktop PC, it's a great platform for specialized tasks.
Chloe: What are some of the specific features that make it good for those tasks?
David: It has features like dual NVMe slots, a GPIO interface, and an energy-efficient design. It's a budget-friendly way to experiment with RISC-V and develop solutions for industrial automation, IoT, and AI applications.
Chloe: Okay, last but not least, we have a story about Anthropic, the company behind the Claude AI, fixing some recent issues with their models. What exactly happened?
David: Between August and early September, Anthropic experienced three separate infrastructure bugs that degraded Claude's response quality. These bugs affected different hardware platforms, like AWS Trainium, NVIDIA GPUs, and Google TPUs.
Chloe: So, Claude wasn't performing as well as it should have been? What kind of problems were users experiencing?
David: Users were reporting degraded responses, which turned out to be due to misrouting requests, errors during token generation, and a bug in the XLA compiler. For example, some users saw Thai or Chinese characters in the middle of English responses, or obvious syntax errors in code.
Chloe: Oh no, that sounds annoying and confusing! How did they fix it?
David: They rolled back problematic code deployments, fixed the routing logic, and worked with the XLA:TPU team on a fix for the compiler bug. They're also improving their evaluation process to catch these kinds of issues earlier.
Chloe: It sounds like it was a complex and multifaceted issue.
David: It really was. Anthropic admits their initial evaluation process didn't catch the issues effectively, and they are taking steps to improve their testing and monitoring. User feedback also played a crucial role in identifying the problems.
Chloe: Well, that was a lot to unpack! So, to recap, we learned about Slack's aggressive billing practices, the exciting advancements in WASM 3.0, the potential of the affordable Orange Pi RV2, and the bug fixes implemented for the Claude AI.
David: Indeed. Today’s stories show the constant evolution and challenges within the tech world, reminding us that innovation comes with both great potential and occasional setbacks.
Chloe: Thanks for breaking it all down for us, David! And thank you for listening, everyone.
David: Thank you, Chloe. Join us tomorrow for another edition of HackerCast!
